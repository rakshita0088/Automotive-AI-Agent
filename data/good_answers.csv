list the  transfer properties ?,"### Transfer Properties

1. **TRIGGERED**
   - Description: At any send request of a signal assigned to an I-PDU with this property, the AUTOSAR COM module shall immediately initiate `ComTxModeNumberOfRepetitions` plus one transmissions of the assigned I-PDU.

2. **TRIGGERED_WITHOUT_REPETITION**
   - Description: At any send request of a signal assigned to an I-PDU with this property, the AUTOSAR COM module shall immediately initiate one transmission of the assigned I-PDU.

3. **TRIGGERED_ON_CHANGE**
   - Description: At a send request of a signal assigned to an I-PDU with this property, the AUTOSAR COM module shall initiate `ComTxModeNumberOfRepetitions` plus one transmissions of the assigned I-PDU if the new sent signal differs from the locally stored (last sent or init) in length or value.

4. **TRIGGERED_ON_CHANGE_WITHOUT_REPETITION**
   - Description: At a send request of a signal assigned to an I-PDU with this property, the AUTOSAR COM module shall initiate one transmission of the assigned I-PDU if the new sent signal differs from the locally stored (last sent or init) in length or value.

5. **PENDING**
   - Description: Defines if a write access to this signal can trigger the transmission of the corresponding I-PDU. If the I-PDU is triggered, it depends also on the transmission mode of the corresponding I-PDU.

### Additional Notes
- The AUTOSAR COM module does not support the transfer properties **TRIGGERED_ON_CHANGE** and **TRIGGERED_ON_CHANGE_WITHOUT_REPETITION** for signals and group signals with `ComBitSize` configured to 0."

transmission flow for DCM stack from  top to bottom  with all the layer s and api,"Here is the step-by-step transmission flow for the Diagnostic Communication Manager (DCM) stack from top to bottom, including all layers and APIs:

### Step-by-Step Transmission Flow

1. **Application Layer**
   - **API:** `Xxx_<DiagnosticService>()`
   - **Purpose:** The application initiates a diagnostic service request, which is processed by the DCM.

2. **RTE (Runtime Environment)**
   - **API:** Not found in context.
   - **Purpose:** The RTE facilitates communication between the application and the DCM, forwarding the service request.

3. **Diagnostic Communication Manager (DCM)**
   - **API:** `Dcm_StartOfReception(PduIdType, PduInfoType*)`
   - **Purpose:** The DCM receives the diagnostic request and prepares to copy the incoming data.

4. **DCM Internal Processing**
   - **API:** `Dcm_CopyRxData(PduIdType, PduInfoType*, PduLengthType*)`
   - **Purpose:** The DCM copies the received data from the provided buffer into its internal buffer.

5. **PDU Router (PduR)**
   - **API:** `PduR_DcmTransmit(PduIdType, const PduInfoType*)`
   - **Purpose:** The DCM requests the PDU Router to transmit the diagnostic response to the appropriate transport layer.

6. **Transport Protocol Layer (e.g., CanTp)**
   - **API:** `CanTp_Transmit(PduIdType, const PduInfoType*)`
   - **Purpose:** The transport protocol layer handles the transmission of the PDU over the network (e.g., CAN, LIN, FlexRay).

7. **Lower Layer Communication Interface (e.g., CanIf)**
   - **API:** `CanIf_Transmit(PduIdType, const PduInfoType*)`
   - **Purpose:** The lower layer communication interface sends the PDU to the physical layer for transmission over the network.

8. **Physical Layer**
   - **API:** Not found in context.
   - **Purpose:** The physical layer transmits the data over the communication medium (e.g., CAN bus).

### Confirmation Flow (from bottom to top)

1. **Physical Layer**
